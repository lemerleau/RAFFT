* FFT-based RNA folding
** Overview
The accuracy and sensitivity of this approach is lower than existing methods.
The gain in speed is similar to Linearfold however, Linearfold performs better
in PPV and sensitivity.

*Note1:* ML-based scores performed better than thermodynamic-based energy
function in PPV and sensitivity. Even for large sequences which may not be
prevalent in their respective training dataset.

*Note2:* LinearFold performed better than ViennaRNA since it uses the ML-based
scoring function from ContraFold. With the same energy function their
performance is the same.

*Note3:* The dataset used here is biased toward structures containing (in
percent) more interior loops and multiloops. In the other hand, the
thermodynamic energy function is not bias toward a specific type of structural
composition.

** Benchmarks
Thermodynamic tools considered: RNAfold (VRNA), LinearFold (Linear)
ML-based tools considered: LinearFold (Linear), ContextFold (ContextFold), Mxfold (Mxfold)

Metrics: PPV, Sensitivity

** Comparisons of thermodynamic methods alone (sequence length-wise)
Vienna (using rna_langdon2018 parameters) and LinearFold (using ContraFold
score) have similar performances. The FFT-based method performed poorly in PVV
and sensitivity.

** Comparisons of thermodynamic with ML methods
NB: The ML based methods crashed on various sequences

The ML based method performed better in both metrics. ContextFold performed
better than all considered methods.

We computed the % of loop types in the true structures and plot them on their
compositions PCA. Then, we colored the structure compositions for which the PVV
< 10%. The thermodynamics-based methods tends to fail when the structure
contains many interior loops.

** Distribution of the structures produced by thermodynamic model and the dataset

The structure dataset seems to be biased toward interior and multi loops. The
thermodynamic model isn't.
