* FFT-based RNA folding
** Overview
The accuracy and sensitivity of this approach is lower than existing methods.
The gain in speed is similar to Linearfold however, Linearfold performs better
in PPV and sensitivity. This has two reasons: first it uses the Contrafold
scoring function (ML-based). However, it produces structures that are closer to
the MFE when using Vienna RNA energy function.

NB: The ML based methods crashed on various sequences

We computed the % of loop types in the true structures and plot them on their
compositions PCA. Then, we colored the structure compositions for which the PVV
< 10%. The thermodynamics-based methods tends to fail when the structure
contains many interior loops.
