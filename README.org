* FFT-based RNA folding
** Overview
** Content
- ~pred_struct.py~, the fft correlation based folding
- ~naive_struct.py~, the naive correlation based folding
- ~vrna_mfe.py~, Zuker MFE exact algorithm using Turner2004 energy model
- ~nussinov.py~, the Nussinov exact algorithm for the BP optimization
** Benchmarks
*** For large sequences, it forms more BPs than the MFE
The difference between the exact maximum number of BP (from Nussinov and minimum
nb of unpaired positions = 3 within loops) and the FFT, MFE, Naive methods:

- The naive method and the FFT ones shows the same performances
- The critical point is not to form a lot of BPs but to chose the ones to form better
*** Measure the energy distance to the MFE
We compared the energy of the predicted structure with the FFT, Nussinov, and
Naive methods:

- This confirms that we need to choose carefully the BPs to form.
*** Measure the BP distance from the MFE (Might not be relevant at this point)
We compared the BP content of the predicted structure to the MFE one:

- The Nussinov algorithm can output many structures, and between them the BP
  distance will also be high (same goes for the FFT and Naive method).
